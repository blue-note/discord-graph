<h2>Definitions:</h2>
<div>
    <b>Multigraph:</b> In a multigraph there can be multiple edges between each node, and each edge represents an
    instance of communication. (an instance of communication is when someone either replies to someone else's message,
    or tags
    someone else.) If a graph is not a multigraph, then each edge represents whether or not communication has occurred
    between two people.
    <br>
    <b>Directed vs. Undirected:</b> Directed graphs preserve the direction of communication, while undirected graphs
    do not.
    <br>
    <b>Betweenness Centrality:</b> The betweenness centrality of a node is the measure of how many shortest paths
    between nodes pass through this node.
    <br>
    <b>Degree Centrality:</b> The degree centrality of a node is the number of connections that node has, divided by the
    maximum number of connections any node in the network has.
    <br>
    <b>Closeness Centrality:</b> The reciprocal of the average shortest path distance from this node to all other nodes.
    <br>
    <b>In-degree vs. Out-degree:</b> In-degree is the number of edges that point to a node, while out-degree is the
    number of edges which leave a node.
    <br>
    <b>Tag mentions:</b> Most of the graphs are computed with the edge weights representing an instance of
    'communication', which could mean either a reply or a tag. However, the tag mentions graphs are computed with only
    tags ('@' mentions).
    <br>
    <b>Relationship Threshold:</b> An arbitrary threshold (10 communications) was chosen to define two nodes as having a
    relationship. Some graphs are computed with only this threshold taken into account.
